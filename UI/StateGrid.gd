class_name StateGrid extends ItemList

## The state grid is in charge of displaying the state of the ui state machine.
## It also takes inputs which allow the user to switch into a different state.
## This switch is then done by the state machine.

## An issue with cleanly coding this is that the information we get on item
## selection is the index of the item in the list. To make this robust, we
## actually fill the ItemList programatically when ready. This makes sure
## we don't go out of sync.
