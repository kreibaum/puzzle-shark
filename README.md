# Puzzle Shark

Puzzle Shark is a jigsaw design software. You can use it to generate and tweak
jigsaw puzzles with irregular piece shapes. You can use it to design individual
jigsaw puzzles for your friends and family, assuming you have a tool to cut
them out.

The most common material we use is plywood sheets. We use a laser cutter to
cut out the pieces. But if you have some other tools that can work based on
SVG files, you can use them too.

## Current Status

We have already cut out puzzles which were designed with Puzzle Shark. Still,
the software is in an early stage and things will be undocumented and sometimes
fiddly to use.

# How we build it

Puzzle Shark is written with the [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/) in 
GDScript. This means that if you currently want to use it, you'll need to
install Godot 4 and run it from source.
